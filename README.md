Developed a robust Book Sales Application using Java and MySQL, enabling users to browse, search, and order books while providing administrators with inventory management capabilities. The application features two user roles—administrators and clients—where clients can view book listings, search for books by authors, and place orders, while administrators manage the inventory by adding and removing books and confirming payments. A secure MySQL database stores book details (ISBN, author, title, publication year, and price) and user information, ensuring efficient data handling. Additionally, a secure login system allows new clients to register and existing clients and administrators to access their accounts seamlessly.
